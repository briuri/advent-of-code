# Advent of Code

This project contains my Advent of Code solutions. I participated in real-time for the 2018-2022 competitions in Java.
I also went back and did 2015-2017 in Java for completeness.

The top-level of the project can be imported as an IntelliJ IDEA project. Solutions are found under 
`puzzles-<language>/src/` with a package naming convention of `buri.aoc.y<yy>.d<dd>`. Each Day can be run from a JUnit 
test harness, colocated in the same source folder as the solution (this reduces the overhead of navigating out to 
`/src/test/` when competing).

## Leaderboard Visualization

In addition to puzzle solutions, this project also contains a simple visualization (under `viz-java/src`) of the 
private leaderboard JSON that can show the data as a median-based [Rankings page](http://aoc.urizone.net).
