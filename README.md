# Advent of Code

This project contains my Advent of Code solutions, written in Java.
I participated in real-time for 2018-2020, and also did 2015-2017 as practice.

The top-level of the project can be imported as an Eclipse project.
Solutions are found under `/src/<year>/` with a package naming convention of `buri.aoc.y<yy>.d<dd>`.
Each Day can be run from a JUnit test harness, colocated in the same source folder as the solution
(this reduces the overhead of navigating out to `/src/test/` when competing).

## Leaderboard Visualization

In addition to puzzle solutions, this project also contains a simple visualization (under `src/viz`) of the private leaderboard JSON
that can show the data as a [Fastest Solve Times page](http://aoc.urizone.net).
