		<li>The first puzzle unlocks at midnight Eastern on December 1st. This is the night of November 30, <i>not</i> the night of December 1!</li>
		<li>Advent of Code is still fun if you don't want to be up at midnight. Do the puzzles later to flex your problem-solving skills or learn a new language!</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Scoring FAQ</h2>	<ul>
		<li>Your daily time to complete each two-part puzzle (worth 2 stars) is measured as "time since the puzzle unlocked at midnight Eastern".</li>		<li>The winner in Novetta's competition will have the most stars by 11:59 PM on December 31.</li>		<li>Last year, 33 people earned all 50 stars. Ties are broken by the <i>lowest median daily time</i> (in other words, your 13th fastest daily time out of 25 if you finish every puzzle).</li>
		<li>Use this page to track everyone's progress since the official private leaderboard uses a different scoring system.</li>
